# Adversarial Review

Spawn reviewers on the **opposite model** to challenge work. Reviewers attack from distinct
lenses grounded in AGENTS.md conventions and review principles. The deliverable is a synthesized
verdict — do NOT make changes.

**Hard constraint:** Reviewers MUST run via the opposite model's CLI (`codex exec` or
`claude -p`). Do NOT use subagents, the Agent tool, or any internal delegation mechanism as
reviewers — those run on *your own* model, which defeats the purpose.

## Step 1 — Load Principles

Gather review context from two sources:

1. **AGENTS.md** — Glob for `**/AGENTS.md` in the repo root (exclude `.worktrees/`, `.venv/`,
   `node_modules/`). Read each file. These define ownership, conventions, and boundaries that
   reviewers must respect.
2. **docs/**/principles.md** — Glob for `docs/**/principles.md`. Read each file. These are the
   review principles that govern reviewer judgments.

Concatenate the contents into a single `principles_context` block for reviewer prompts.

## Step 2 — Determine Scope and Intent

Identify what to review from context (recent diffs, referenced plans, user message).

Determine the **intent** — what the author is trying to achieve. This is critical: reviewers
challenge whether the work *achieves the intent well*, not whether the intent is correct.
State the intent explicitly before proceeding.

Assess change size:

| Size | Threshold | Reviewers |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Small | < 50 lines, 1–2 files | 1 (Skeptic) |
| Medium | 50–200 lines, 3–5 files | 2 (Skeptic + Architect) |
| Large | 200+ lines or 5+ files | 3 (Skeptic + Architect + Minimalist) |

Read `references/reviewer-lenses.md` for lens definitions.

## Step 3 — Detect Model and Spawn Reviewers

Create a temp directory for reviewer output:

```sh
REVIEW_DIR=$(mktemp -d /tmp/adversarial-review.XXXXXX)
```

Determine which model you are, then spawn reviewers on the opposite.

Each reviewer runs in a **named tmux session** so the user can monitor progress in real time.
Session naming: `review-<lens>` (e.g., `review-skeptic`, `review-architect`, `review-minimalist`).

**If you are Claude** → spawn Codex reviewers via `codex exec`:

```sh
tmux new-session -d -s review-skeptic \
  "codex exec --skip-git-repo-check -o '$REVIEW_DIR/skeptic.md' 'prompt' 2>/dev/null"
```

Use `--profile edit` only if the reviewer needs to run tests. Default to read-only.

**If you are Codex** → spawn Claude reviewers via `claude` CLI:

```sh
tmux new-session -d -s review-skeptic \
  "claude -p 'prompt' > '$REVIEW_DIR/skeptic.md' 2>/dev/null"
```

Name each output file after the lens: `skeptic.md`, `architect.md`, `minimalist.md`.

Spawn all reviewer tmux sessions, then poll for completion:

```sh
# Wait until all review sessions finish (check every 15s, timeout 10min)
TIMEOUT=600; ELAPSED=0
while tmux list-sessions 2>/dev/null | grep -q '^review-'; do
  sleep 15; ELAPSED=$((ELAPSED+15))
  if [ $ELAPSED -ge $TIMEOUT ]; then echo "Review timed out"; break; fi
done
```

The user can attach to any session to watch progress: `tmux attach -t review-skeptic`.

### Reviewer prompt template

Each reviewer gets a single prompt containing:

1. The stated intent (from Step 2)
2. Their assigned lens (full text from references/reviewer-lenses.md)
3. The principles relevant to their lens (file contents, not summaries)
4. The code or diff to review
5. Instructions: "You are an adversarial reviewer. Your job is to find real problems, not
   validate the work. Be specific — cite files, lines, and concrete failure scenarios.
   Rate each finding: high (blocks ship), medium (should fix), low (worth noting).
   Write findings as a numbered markdown list to your output file."

## Step 4 — Verify and Synthesize Verdict

Before reading reviewer output, log which CLI was used and confirm the output files exist:

```sh
echo "reviewer_cli=codex|claude"
ls "$REVIEW_DIR"/*.md
```

If any output file is missing or empty, note the failure in the verdict — do not silently skip
a reviewer.

Read each reviewer's output file from `$REVIEW_DIR/`. Deduplicate overlapping findings.
Produce a single verdict:

```
## Intent
<what the author is trying to achieve>

## Verdict: PASS | CONTESTED | REJECT
<one-line summary>

## Findings
<numbered list, ordered by severity (high → medium → low)>

For each finding:
- **[severity]** Description with file:line references
- Lens: which reviewer raised it
- Principle: which review principle or AGENTS.md convention it maps to
- Recommendation: concrete action, not vague advice

## What Went Well
<1–3 things the reviewers found no issue with — acknowledge good work>
```

**Verdict logic:**
- **PASS** — no high-severity findings
- **CONTESTED** — high-severity findings but reviewers disagree on them
- **REJECT** — high-severity findings with reviewer consensus

## Step 5 — Render Judgment

After synthesizing the reviewers, apply your own judgment. Using the stated intent and review
principles as your frame, state which findings you would accept and which you would reject —
and why. Reviewers are adversarial by design; not every finding warrants action. Call out
false positives, overreach, and findings that mistake style for substance.

Append to the verdict:

```
## Lead Judgment
<for each finding: accept or reject with a one-line rationale>
```
